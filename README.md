# Crazyflie_Keyboard
A working (as of January 2024) keyboard control setup for a Crazyflie, in the most basic terms available. The first script works without a Flow Deck. I intend to add a second script that uses the Flow Deck when I get the time.

```
python kcontrol_basic.py
```

Controls are as follows:

 - Tap spacebar and c to increment your vertical thrust upwards or downwards.
 - Hold Q or E to turn right or left.
 - Hold WASD to strafe along the horizontal plane.
 - Tap the 'L' key to cut engine power and exit the program.
